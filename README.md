0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Resources for the project:
Read or watch:

Sorting algorithm
Big O notation
Sorting algorithms animations
15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes (WARNING: The following video can trigger seizure/epilepsy. It is not required for the project, as it is only a funny visualization of different sorting algorithms)
CS50 Algorithms explanation in detail by David Malan
All about sorting algorithms

Objectives of the project:
General
At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm
